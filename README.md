- Add new todos to the list
- Ability to hit ENTER key and add TODO to a list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- At the top of the list user should be able to see different inspirational quote each time user refreshes the page
- The quote should be fetched from the following API: https://type.fit/api/quotes
